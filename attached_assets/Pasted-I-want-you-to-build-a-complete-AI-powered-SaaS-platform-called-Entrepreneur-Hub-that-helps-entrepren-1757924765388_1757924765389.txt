I want you to build a complete AI-powered SaaS platform called Entrepreneur Hub that helps entrepreneurs with business ideation, funding, market analysis, legal compliance, mentorship, and personalized learning roadmaps. The project must be production-ready, modular, and scalable, including frontend, backend, AI/ML integration, database, authentication, APIs, and cloud deployment setup.

üéØ Core Functionalities

User Onboarding & Authentication

Sign up/login via email, Google, LinkedIn.

During onboarding, users upload their skills/knowledge (resume, text input, file).

Store user preferences (industry, skills, budget, target goals).

AI Business Idea Generation

AI suggests personalized startup ideas based on user skills, budget, and industry.

Use GPT or LLaMA models with prompt templates.

Market & Competitor Analysis

AI analyzes trends, demand, and competitors using APIs (Google Trends, Crunchbase, etc.).

Visualize insights in interactive graphs/charts.

AI Business Mentor

Chatbot interface for mentorship (funding, scaling, marketing strategies).

AI generates business plans and financial models.

Funding & Networking Hub

Match entrepreneurs with investors, grants, loans, crowdfunding platforms.

AI-powered funding recommendations based on profile.

Legal & Compliance Automation

Provide checklists of licenses/registrations (localized per country).

Auto-generate legal document templates (NDAs, agreements, MoUs).

Business Scaling & Growth

Track KPIs & performance metrics (revenue, customer growth, burn rate).

AI suggests scaling strategies & automation improvements.

Personalized Learning Roadmap (New Feature)

After skill upload, AI creates a step-by-step roadmap for user to become a specialist in chosen domain.

Roadmap includes skills required, resources (courses/books), timeline, milestones, mentors.

Progress tracker with gamified dashboard (badges, completion %).

Integration with Coursera, Udemy, EdX APIs to suggest learning resources.
